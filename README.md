This project is for "Air Quality Monitoring using F450 Drone". For this project, I have integrated MQ135, MQ7, PM2.5 GP2Y1010AU0F and DHT11 sensors with ESP32 for real-time monitoring.
First set up the dust sensor - PM2.5 GP2Y1010AU0F with the ESP32 and then step by step add the other sensors. You can follow any of the youtube videos for the connections, but follow the pin arrangement as per the code given in the file - dust.ino
The final code is given in final.ino
